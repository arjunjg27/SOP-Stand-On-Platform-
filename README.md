# SOP-Stand-On-Platform-
This was just me trying out some pygame before my first game jam. Link: https://itch.io/jam/2d-game-jam-official. This game is litterally just its name stand on the platform and gain points. But its not really worth it since the platform only changes when you jump so you can just stay on the platform for forever. This was my first pygame project so I used a lot of stack overflow, chatgpt, and google. So don't be surprised when the code looks different from the rest of my repos. If you want to know. Mechanics I coded myself (below):
MECHANICS I CODED MYSELF:
-Basic Player Movement
-Dash ability and logic
-Screen Hitboxes
-Points Mechanic and Showing up in terminal (I didn't code that it only shows up when you gain points. I'm dumb sorry).
-The creation of rect_x to change position(I didn't code how to place rectangle. Again, i'm dumb sorry).
-Rectangle/Platform Hitboxes (Used a little bit of Chatgpt help with this because I couldn't understand to keep the player on the platform)

CONTROLS:

A: Move left
D: Move Right
Spacebar: Jump
Shift and A: Dash Left as long as your jumping
Shift and D: Dash Right as long as your jumpign
Jumping: Changes x of rectangle
